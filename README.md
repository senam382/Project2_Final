# Project2_Final

Scientific Question: How accurate is the Tyrer Cuzick risk assessment score that classify people at either average or high risk for breast cancer? 

Scientific Hypothesis: If patients that are classified to be at high-risk of cancer show differently expressed genes, then those genes will help explain the possible breast cancer signatures for further research.
